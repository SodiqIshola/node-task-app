
📦 How to Run Everything in Your Node.js Project
*********************************************************************************************************
🧱 1. Install Dependencies (First Time Only)
    npm install
Why?
    This installs all required libraries defined in dependencies and devDependencies (like express, jest, nodemon). 
    You can't run or test the app without them.
It generates these two files 

1. node_modules/ folder
    This is where all the actual code for the dependencies is downloaded and stored.
    It includes:
        Your direct dependencies.
        Their dependencies (transitive dependencies).
        It's used at runtime to resolve modules via require() or import.

2. package-lock.json file
    This file locks the dependency tree, recording the exact versions of every package (and their sub-dependencies) that were installed.
    Purpose:
        Ensures repeatable installs — every team member or deployment gets the same versions.
        Tracks the entire dependency tree, not just your top-level dependencies (those in package.json).
        It's auto-generated and updated when you run npm install.

Summary
File/Folder Purpose
    node_modules/ Contains all installed packages (runtime code).
    package-lock.json Describes exactly what was installed — used to reproduce the install reliably.

1. Install Dependencies
    npm ci
What npm ci Does: npm ci (short for clean install) does the following:
1. Deletes the existing node_modules/ folder (if it exists).

2. Skips package.json resolution — it uses the exact versions listed in package-lock.json.
3. Installs dependencies strictly based on package-lock.json.
4. Fails if:
    package-lock.json is missing.
    package.json and package-lock.json are out of sync.

When to Use npm ci
    In CI/CD pipelines or automated builds.
    When you want fast, clean, and repeatable installs.
    When you want to ensure no implicit version updates from the registry.

Difference Between npm install and npm ci
**********************************************************************************************
Imagine you're building a LEGO model
npm install
    You have a shopping list (package.json) and some ideas about what LEGO pieces you need.
    You go to the store and say: “Give me this piece, or the latest version that works.”
    You might have to browse, compare versions, and then update your list (package-lock.json) based on what you actually get.
    It takes longer, and what you bring back might not match what someone else gets unless they have the same luck.

npm ci
    You already have a detailed list (package-lock.json) with the exact pieces and versions you need.
    You go straight to the shelf, pick up exactly what’s on the list, and build.
    No guesswork. No updates. No changes.

It’s faster because:
    You don’t have to think.
    You don’t compare versions.
    You don’t write or change any files.
    You start fresh (it clears out the old LEGO pieces first — node_modules/).

So npm ci is like using a recipe with exact brands and quantities — faster, no surprises, and perfect for automated systems.

When to Use npm install
***********************************************************8
    Use it on your local machine during development.
It's what you run after editing package.json to:
    Install new dependencies.
    Generate or update the package-lock.json.
    It builds the lock file, which freezes the versions of all dependencies.

When to Use npm ci
********************************************************************8
Use it only after package-lock.json exists — typically in:
    CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
    Docker builds or clean test environments.
    It’s for speed and consistency, not for adding new packages.
    It will fail if package-lock.json is missing or outdated.


🛠️ 2. Run in Development Mode
    npm run dev
What it does:
    Starts the server using nodemon, which watches for file changes and restarts automatically.

Why?
    Ideal for development, fast iteration, and debugging. You shouldn't use the production environment 
    until your features are stable.

🧪 3. Run Tests with Code Coverage
    npm test
What it does:
    Runs all test cases with jest and generates a code coverage report, including a SonarQube-compatible report.
Why?
    Validates functionality before building or deploying.
    Ensures your code meets the required test coverage.
    Needed before running SonarQube analysis.

🧹 4. Optional: Lint the Code
    npm run lint
What it does:
    Runs ESLint (if configured) to catch syntax errors, code style violations, and best practice issues.
Why?
    Keeps your code clean, readable, and less prone to bugs.

🏗️ 5. Build the App (Optional Placeholder)
    npm run build
What it does:
    Currently a placeholder (echo), but this can be extended if using TypeScript, Babel, or Webpack in future.
Why?
    Not needed for plain Node.js, but useful in real-world apps where build transforms the code.

🚀 6. Run in Production
    npm start
What it does:
    Starts the server in production mode, with NODE_ENV=production.
Why?
    This is the final version that should be deployed. You should only start after testing passes.

💡 Summary Table: Execution Order
Step	Command	    Purpose	                            Mandatory?
1	npm install	    Set up project	                        ✅ Yes
2	npm run dev	    Develop and debug	                    ✅ Yes
3	npm test	    Validate with unit tests	            ✅ Yes
4	npm run lint	Linting for code quality (optional)	    ⚪ Optional
5	npm run build	Compile/build code (if needed)	        ⚪ Optional
6	npm start	    Deploy/run app in production	        ✅ Yes





🔹 What is npm prestart?
****************************************************************************************888
In your package.json, you can define "lifecycle scripts". One of them is prestart.
"scripts": {
  "prestart": "npm run test",
  "start": "NODE_ENV=production node index.js"
}

👉 What does this do?
When you run npm start, npm run prestart is executed first automatically.
So it will run tests before actually starting your app.

✅ Difference between npm run prestart and npm test
Command	                    Description
npm start	                Runs prestart first (if defined), then start.
npm run prestart	        Manually runs the script defined as prestart. Usually you don’t call this directly.
npm test or npm run test	Directly runs the test suite (whatever you define under "test").

🧠 Summary: What Happens?
If you have this in your package.json:

"scripts": {
  "test": "jest --coverage",
  "prestart": "npm run test",
  "start": "NODE_ENV=production node index.js"
}
npm start will:
    Run npm run test (because of prestart)
    Then start the app.

🔒 Why is this useful?
Prestart is defensive. It ensures the code passes tests before it can even start.

Helps prevent deploying or running broken code in production.

You can add more commands:

json
Copy
Edit
"prestart": "npm run lint && npm test"
🟡 Important Notes
You can also define other lifecycle hooks like prebuild, pretest, etc.

These are automatically recognized and executed by npm before their parent script.

Let me know if you want an example pipeline that includes prestart, or how to add prebuild for frontend frameworks or TypeScript!
